            <p class="ok">I want to become a businessman because it runs in my family. I understand it very well. Also, because I have a lot of friends who run their own businesses. And what excites me the most is that I get to be my own boss. I don't like it when people boss me around like a kid.</p>
			<hr>
			<p class="ok">I also want to study criminal justice. I love that field because it's a government job. And what made me like it a lot, is that I have a friend who just graduated. He told me it's a great field to be in because it's interesting. Also what excites me about this field is that it has a lot of stuff to do and it has a lot of benefits.</p>
